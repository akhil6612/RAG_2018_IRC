This chapter contains provisions for the application, enforcement and administration of subsequent requirements of the code. In addition to establishing the scope of the code, Chapter 1 identifies which buildings and structures come under its purview. Chapter 1 is largely concerned with maintaining “due process of law” in enforcing the building criteria contained in the body of the code. Only through careful observation of the administrative provisions can the building official reasonably expect to demonstrate that “equal protection under the law” has been provided.'),

It is important to note that two chapters have their own definitions sections: Chapter 11 for the defined terms unique to energy conservation, Chapter 24 for the defined terms that are unique to fuel gas and Chapter 35 containing terms that are applicable to electrical Chapters 34 through 43. Where Chapter 24 or 35 defines a term differently than it is defined in Chapter 2, the definition applies in that chapter only. Chapter 2 definitions apply in all other locations in the code. Where understanding a term’s definition is key to or necessary for understanding a particular code provision, the term is shown in italics where it appears in the code. This is true only for those terms that have a meaning that is unique to the code. In other words, the generally understood meaning of a term or phrase might not be sufficient or consistent with the meaning prescribed by the code; therefore, it is essential that the code-defined meaning be known. Guidance regarding not only tense, gender and plurality of defined terms, but also terms not defined in this code, is provided.'),

Document(metadata={'chapter': 23}, page_content='Chapter 23 Solar Thermal Energy Systems. Chapter 23 contains requirements for the construction, alteration and repair of all systems and components of solar thermal energy systems used for space heating or cooling, and domestic hot water heating or processing. The provisions of this chapter are limited to those necessary to achieve installations that are relatively hazard free. A solar thermal energy system can be designed to handle 100 percent of the energy load of a building, although this is rarely accomplished. Because solar energy is a low-intensity energy source and dependent on the weather, it is usually necessary to supplement a solar thermal energy system with traditional energy sources. As our world strives to find alternate means of producing power for the future, the requirements of this chapter will become more and more important over time.'),
